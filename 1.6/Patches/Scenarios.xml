    <value>Your gravjumper sits docked at the orbital relay. As your crew begins to salvage the equipment, you realize that this isn't ancient human tech - it's a mechanoid beacon. The relay crackles to life and broadcasts its war alert to a distant mechhive. They're hunting you now, and they will eventually find you wherever you go.\n\nNote: This is a difficult scenario and is not recommended for new players.</value>

    <value>You screwed up, and now the mechhive wants you dead. Its terrifying murder machines will arrive soon. Gather the valuable gravlite panels, then use your gravjumper to flee to a safe location on the planet below.\n\nTo launch the gravjumper, select the pilot cockpit, then select the launch command.\n\nOn the world map, select ‘view planet' to choose a landing spot on the planet.\n\nFrom now on, wherever you go, the mechanoids will eventually find you. To stop them, you must find and defeat the mechhive itself.</value>
