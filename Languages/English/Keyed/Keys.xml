    <VGE_MapDecisionText>Your gravship has launched. You can now decide whether you want to keep the previous map around, or if you want to discard it.

If you keep it around, it will still be present as a colony map until you abandon it.

If you discard it, a crater will be created in it’s place and you will never be able to visit it again.
Please note that keeping several maps open may affect your performance.</VGE_MapDecisionText>
